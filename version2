#CFU#12 Version 2 : Modify Version 1 so that the User gets only 3 chances. HINTS:  Use a variable to keep track of the number of guesses.The User is stuck in the While loop as long as num_guesses < 3 and guess != PW
password = "Alaia47g"
num_guesses = 0
max_guesses = 3
correct = False

while num_guesses < max_guesses and not correct:
    user_input = input("Enter the password: ")
    if user_input == password:
        print("Correct! You may enter...")
        correct = True
    else:
        print("Wrong Password!")
        num_guesses += 1

if not correct:
    print("Out of attempts!")
